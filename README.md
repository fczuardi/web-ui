# web-ui
## UI components for web applications.

Currently there isn't much to see here, this is just a place for me to store
open source work that I do for clients that accepted that I release my code
under a free-software license, (AGPL-3.0).

The component sets and automated tests from this repository will probably
not work out-of-the box because they were just copied from another projects
with different setups and dependencies each.

However, feel free to browse, study and reuse them if you can, it should be
easy to find out what's missing just by reading the code ;)
